//
// why have tsconfig.json + tsconfig.build.json?
// @see https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/issues/123
//
// basically, it's not possible currently, to import
// @testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect globally
// so that Jest actually uses it AND so that the IDE uses it too
// but at the same time, the build script, does not.
//
// if we exclude the test files in tsconfig.json, the IDE
// complains about the Jest DOM custom matchers.
// if we keep them, they get included in the /dist...
